# Steem dApp starter template based on Vue 3, Bootstrap 5, SASS with Dark Light/Theme and Typescript

This template was created to help Steem developers jumpstart their development.
It uses **Vue 3** with **Composition API** and **Typescript** support and added **Bootstrap 5** with support for **SASS** **Different Color Themes** and **Dark Themes**.

## Developer notes

There is one layout (Default) â€” but more layouts can be easily added. Layouts are changed based on [Nested Named Routes](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html#nested-named-routes) in Vue Router. This way does not use dynamic imports and works faster.
